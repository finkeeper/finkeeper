## Technical Architecture
### Core Workflow
  
FinKeeper's core workflow is designed to streamline the process of liquidity provision and yield farming, making it accessible and efficient for users of all levels of experience. The platform automates the complex steps involved in participating in DeFi protocols, allowing users to deposit their tokens and let the smart contract handle the rest.

#### Step 1: Liquidity Supply

-   **Input**: Flexible multi-token deposit
-   **Blockchain Support**: Primary TON Blockchain
-   **Ecosystem Partners**: DeDust, Ston.fi, Tonstakers
-   **Flexibility**: Cross-token compatibility with integrated DEX pools

Users can deposit any supported tokens into the FinKeeper platform without worrying about compatibility or conversion.

#### Step 2: Intra-Contract Token Conversion

-   **Mechanism**: Automatic token swapping within smart contract
-   **Objective**: Align deposited assets with partner liquidity pool requirements
-   **Zero-Touch Operation**: Fully autonomous, no user intervention needed

FinKeeper's smart contract automatically handles the conversion of deposited tokens into the required tokens for the target liquidity pools. This seamless process eliminates the need for users to manually exchange tokens on decentralized exchanges, saving time.

#### Step 3: Liquidity Pool Integration

-   **Action**: Token allocation to partner liquidity pools
-   **Output**: Acquisition of native LP tokens
-   **Protocols**: Decentralized exchanges and lending platforms

The platform efficiently allocates the converted tokens into the chosen partner protocols' liquidity pools. By integrating with trusted DeFi platforms, FinKeeper ensures that users' assets are deployed in yield-generating opportunities with proven track records.

#### Step 4: LP Token Wrapping

-   **Process**: 1:1 wrapping of partner LP tokens
-   **Objective**: Generate native FinKeeper LP tokens
-   **User Benefit**: Standardized representation of liquidity share

FinKeeper issues its own LP tokens to represent users' shares in the underlying liquidity pools. These wrapped tokens provide a consistent and user-friendly way to track and manage investments across multiple protocols within the FinKeeper ecosystem.

#### Step 5: User Withdrawal Mechanism

-   **Trigger**: User-initiated withdrawal request
-   **Smart Contract Actions**:
    1.  Native LP token burning
    2.  Redemption of original LP tokens
    3.  Reward accumulation retrieval

When users decide to withdraw their assets, FinKeeper's smart contract efficiently unwinds their positions. The process includes burning the FinKeeper LP tokens, reclaiming the original LP tokens from partner protocols, and collecting any accrued rewards, ensuring users receive their initial investment plus any profits earned.

#### Step 6: Liquidity & Reward Settlement

-   **Token Conversion**: Flexible back-to-original token swapping
-   **Fee Structure**: FinKeeper service commission deduction
-   **Settlement**: Direct wallet transfer

The platform handles the final conversion of tokens back to the user's preferred assets if necessary, deducts a small service fee, and transfers the funds directly to the user's wallet. This streamlined process provides a hassle-free experience from deposit to withdrawal.

    class A,H blue;  
    class B,F green;  
    class C,D,E,G red;
```
#### Leverage Mechanism

-   **Collateral Utilization**: Deposited liquidity as loan collateral
-   **Lending Protocol Integration**
-   **Dynamic Fund Allocation**
    -   User funds
    -   Borrowed capital

By utilizing the deposited assets as collateral, FinKeeper allows users to access additional capital through integrated lending protocols. This leveraged position enables users to amplify their investment capacity and potential returns, all managed seamlessly within the platform.

#### Auto-Compounding Engine

-   **Reward Collection**: Automatic harvesting across partner protocols
-   **Reinvestment Strategy**:
    1.  Reward token conversion
    2.  Liquidity pool reintegration
    3.  Compounded yield generation

FinKeeper's auto-compounding feature automatically collects rewards from various protocols and reinvests them to generate compounded yields. This process increases the overall return on investment without requiring users to manually claim and reinvest their rewards.

#### Risk Management

-   **Continuous Monitoring**:
    -   Collateralization ratio tracking
    -   Liquidation risk prevention
    -   Automatic position optimization

The platform includes robust risk management tools that continuously monitor users' leveraged positions. By tracking collateralization ratios and adjusting positions as needed, FinKeeper minimizes the risk of liquidation and ensures the security of users' assets.
