We will incorporate your contribution into the project’s codebase, adapt it as needed, and give you full credit for your work.

###  Contributions
We accept a wide range of contributions, including code, documentation, and artistic works, as long as they are valuable and useful. The easier it is for us to integrate your contribution, the better. However, if your contribution is of high quality, we will make the necessary effort to use it.

### From anyone
We accept contributions from anyone, regardless of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, lifestyle, political viewpoint, or any other extraneous factors. Contributions are judged solely on their quality. However, we reserve the right to reject contributions if the contributor behaves inappropriately.

### That we can use
Your contribution must:

* Be your own work, and you must have the right to contribute it
* Be made under a license compatible with the project’s license, allowing us to include, distribute, and modify your work without restriction

## If Your Contribution Is Rejected
Rejection of your contribution does not reflect on you personally; it simply means that the contribution was not suitable for our project in its current form. If you ask civilly, we will discuss the reasons for rejection and help you understand how to improve your contribution for future acceptance. If we cannot reach an agreement, you are free to fork our project and add your contribution to your fork, as with any Open Source project.
